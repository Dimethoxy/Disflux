# Disflux Project (Work in Progress)

Welcome to our Disflux project! This repository aims to create an open-source, cross-platform audio plugin that replicates the core functionality of the Kilohearts Disperser plugin.

As this project is still in its early stages, several features are under active development.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project include:

- **Linux Support:** Ensuring full compatibility with Linux-based digital audio workstations (DAWs) and workflows, making this plugin accessible across all major platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).
- **CLAP Plugin Format:** Supporting the open-source and developer-friendly CLAP plugin format, alongside traditional VST3, to encourage broader community engagement and better performance.
- **Optimized Performance:** Ensuring the plugin runs efficiently in real-time, with minimal CPU usage, making it suitable for professional audio production in low-latency environments.

## Current Status

- Nothing
