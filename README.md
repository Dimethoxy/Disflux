# Disflux

> [!WARNING]
> Disflux is currently a work in progress. While it's functional, there are unfinished features, and some buttons or functionalities may not work as expected.
> Expect updates and improvements as we continue development!

Disflux is a wild audio effect plugin that takes your transients and smears them through time, adding serious punch and weight. If you're creating Hard Techno or Rawstyle and need your kicks to hit like a freaking train, Disflux is your new best friend. We're talking aggressive, distorted, gated kicks that smack like no tomorrow.

Using a chain of all-pass filters, Disflux spreads those high-energy transients through time, giving you that laser-like effect. Think of it as a cross between a short reverb and a falling sine wave. It injects depth and impact into your punch. Outside of kicks, it‚Äôs also perfect for crafting experimental soundscapes and other weird, next-level audio magic.

## üìú License

The source code is licensed under the **GPLv3**. If you download the source or create builds, you must comply with that license. For more information, visit [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

## üîê Privacy

**Disflux** is built with privacy in mind. It **does not collect any personal data** or send any telemetry. We are committed to **never sharing or selling your data**. However, some features that require networking may affect your privacy. We want to be transparent about these and explain how they work.

### Update Checking

On certain systems, **Disflux** may attempt to connect to the internet to check for updates. This process is entirely anonymous, and **no personal information is sent** during the check.

### Disabling Update Notifications

If you prefer to disable update notifications, you can compile **Disflux** without these checks by using the following CMake flag:

```bash
-DDMT_DISABLE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION=ON
```

Some pre-built versions, like those available from the **Arch User Repository (AUR)**, may already have this option enabled by default. This is because these builds are managed by package managers that handle updates on their own, making the update check unnecessary.

### Third-Party Tools and Telemetry

We use third-party libraries, such as [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE), to help with plugin development. While we are not aware of any telemetry or data collection within these tools, we recommend you do your own research to ensure you are comfortable with their data practices.

If we discover any issues or unexpected data collection, we will address them immediately and update you accordingly.
